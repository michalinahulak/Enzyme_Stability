This project was created during Data Science course for intermediate. It contains a regression problem.  

## Introduction
In this Data Science project, we aim to predict enzyme stability (tm) using machine learning and deep learning models. Enzyme stability is an important factor in determining the performance and shelf life of industrial enzymes, which are used in a variety of applications including food processing, pharmaceuticals, and biofuels. 

The biggest challenge in the project was extracting information from the amino acid sequences. We used the ESM model to convert the amino acid sequences into vectors. Additionally, using the BioPython library, we extracted physicochemical properties from the amino acid sequences.

## Goal
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict enzyme stability based on their pH and protein sequence.

## The repository contains:

* Enzyme_Stability_Prediction.ipynb -notebook with preprocessing and modeling
* Enzyme_stability_presentation.pdf - final presentation with introduction, goal, results and conclusions
* enzyme_head.jpg - readm.me header photo
* enzyme_stability_dataset.csv - dataset which was used

## How to Run the Project?
To open the project, use the git clone command or download the selected files.

## Additional information
We encourage you to explore the Enzyme_stability_presentation.pdf file included in the repository. It provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including an introduction to the topic, the project's goals, the methodology used for feature extraction, the models employed, and the evaluation metrics obtained. It also presents the results and draws insightful conclusions.
