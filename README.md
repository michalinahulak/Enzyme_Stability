This project was created during Data Science course for intermediate. It contains a regression problem.  

## Introduction
In this Data Science project, we aim to predict enzyme stability (tm) using machine learning and deep learning models. Enzyme stability is an important factor in determining the performance and shelf life of industrial enzymes, which are used in a variety of applications including food processing, pharmaceuticals, and biofuels. 

## Goal
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict enzyme stability based on their pH and protein sequence.

## The repository contains:
